# Sex chromosome / scaffold

In this directory, we blast the chicken Z chromosome to the 30 largest scaffolds of the black grouse reference genome, to identify which scaffold(s) is/are not autosomal. The *Gallus gallus* Z chromosome can be downloaded from NCBI under https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_016699485.2/ and should be stored in `data/genomic/intermediate` with file name `gallus_gallus_Zchr.fasta`
