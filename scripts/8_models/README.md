# Modelling

In this sub-directory, we build various Bayesian and frequentist models to answer whether deleterious mutations affect lifetime reproductive success, and whether this is mediated through the sexual traits. In the `lms` folder, we use the various types of genetic load as predictor variables and lifetime mating success (LMS) as the response variable. In the `traits` folder, we model the effect of genetic load on the various sexual and behavioural traits, and the effect of the traits on annual mating success. As both of these modelling approaches are repetitive for the various types of load (GERP vs SnpEff, different GERP categories, looking at additive or co-dominant total load, all regions vs specific gene regions), these models were implemented using Snakemake to iterate over similar model structures.
