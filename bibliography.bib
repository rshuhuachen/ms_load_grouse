  abstract = {Population structure can dramatically alter mutation load, but the magnitude and direction of this effect depend on whether selection is soft or hard. The abstract nature of previous load models obscured the importance of ecological details in determining the softness of selection. Under the more ecologically explicit model used here, I show that genes related to intrinsic growth rate tend to experience hard selection whereas those genes affecting competitive ability experience softer selection. Although resource limitation determines the strength of selection on competitive ability, it only affects the softness of selection, and thus the load, of mutations with pleiotropic effects on intrinsic growth rate. While competition is typically considered necessary for soft selection, the model shows that interspecific competition hardens selection and can thereby lead to reduced load. Finally, genetic variation in the consumption rates of individuals who die before reproduction can cause supersoft selection, resulting in large increases in load. The same conditions that increase mutation load also increase inbreeding depression.},

  abstract = {Many multicellular eukaryotes have reasonably high per-generation mutation rates. Consequently, most populations harbor an abundance of segregating deleterious alleles. These alleles, most of which are of small effect individually, collectively can reduce substantially the fitness of individuals relative to what it would be otherwise; this is mutation load. Mutation load can be lessened by any factor that causes more mutations to be removed per selective death, such as inbreeding, synergistic epistasis, population structure, or harsh environments. The ecological effects of load are not clear-cut because some conditions (such as selection early in life, sexual selection, reproductive compensation, and intraspecific competition) reduce the effects of load on population size and persistence, but other conditions (such as interspecific competition and load on resource use efficiency) can cause small amounts of load to have strong effects on the population, even extinction. We suggest a series of studies to improve our understanding of the effects of mutation load.},

Despite these successes, much of the heritability of these traits remains unexplained. Because low-frequency and rare variants are not tagged by conventional genome-wide genotyping arrays, they may represent an important and understudied component of complex trait genetics. In contrast to common variant GWASs, there are many different types of study designs, assays and analytic techniques that can be utilized for rare variant association studies (RVASs). In this review, we briefly present the different technologies available to identify rare genetic variants, including novel exome arrays. We also compare the different study designs for RVASs and argue that the best design will likely be phenotype-dependent. We discuss the main analytical issues relevant to RVASs, including the different statistical methods that can be used to test genetic associations with rare variants and the various bioinformatic approaches to predicting in silico biological functions for variants. Finally, we describe recent rare variant association findings, highlighting the unexpected conclusion that most rare variants have modest-to-small effect sizes on phenotypic variation. This observation has major implications for our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits in the context of the unexplained heritability challenge.},

This pattern contrasts with that for the load, which increases as population size becomes smaller but decreases as inbreeding rate goes up. The depression and load both approach asymptotic limits when the population size becomes very large or very small. Numerical results show that the transition between the small and the large population regimes is quite rapid, and occurs largely over a range of population sizes that vary by a factor of 10.

  abstract = {The inbreeding coefficient (F) of individuals can be estimated from molecular marker data, such as SNPs, using measures of homozygosity of individual markers or runs of homozygosity (ROH) across the genome. These different measures of F can then be used to estimate the rate of inbreeding depression (ID) for quantitative traits. Some recent simulation studies have investigated the accuracy of this estimation with contradictory results. Whereas some studies suggest that estimates of inbreeding from ROH account more accurately for ID, others suggest that inbreeding measures from SNP-by-SNP homozygosity giving a large weight to rare alleles are more accurate. Here, we try to give more light on this issue by carrying out a set of computer simulations considering a range of population genetic parameters and population sizes. Our results show that the previous studies are indeed not contradictory. In populations with low effective size, where relationships are more tight and selection is relatively less intense, F measures based on ROH provide very accurate estimates of ID whereas SNP-by-SNP-based F measures with high weight to rare alleles can show substantial upwardly biased estimates of ID. However, in populations of large effective size, with more intense selection and trait allele frequencies expected to be low if they are deleterious for fitness because of purifying selection, average estimates of ID from SNP-by-SNP-based F values become unbiased or slightly downwardly biased and those from ROH-based F values become slightly downwardly biased. The noise attached to all these estimates, nevertheless, can be very high in large-sized populations. We also investigate the relationship between the different F measures and the homozygous mutation load, which has been suggested as a proxy of inbreeding depression.},

Using population genetics models, numerical predictions of the genetic load, inbreeding depression and heterosis were obtained for a broad range of selection coefficients and mutation rates. The models allowed for the possibility of very high mutation rates per nucleotide site, as is sometimes observed for epiallelic mutations in plants. There was fairly good quantitative agreement between the theoretical predictions and empirical estimates of heterosis and the effects of population size on genetic load, on the assumption that the deleterious mutation rate per individual per generation is approximately one, but there was less good agreement for inbreeding depression. Weak selection, of the order of magnitude suggested by population genomic data, is required to explain the observed patterns. Possible caveats concerning the applicability of the models are discussed.},

The Scandinavian arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) is highly fragmented, with a once continuous, circumpolar distribution, it struggled to recover from a demographic bottleneck in the late 19th century. The future persistence of the entire Scandinavian population is highly dependent on the northernmost Fennoscandian subpopulations (Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula), to provide a link to the viable Siberian population. By analyzing 43 arctic fox genomes, we quantified genomic variation and inbreeding in these populations. Signatures of genome erosion increased from Siberia to northern Sweden indicating a stepping-stone model of connectivity. In northern Fennoscandia, runs of homozygosity (ROH) were on average \textasciitilde 1.47-fold longer than ROH found in Siberia, stretching almost entire scaffolds. Moreover, consistent with recent inbreeding, northern Fennoscandia harbored more homozygous deleterious mutations, whereas Siberia had more in heterozygous state. This study underlines the value of documenting genome erosion following population fragmentation to identify areas requiring conservation priority. With the increasing fragmentation and isolation of Arctic habitats due to global warming, understanding the genomic and demographic consequences is vital for maintaining evolutionary potential and preventing local extinctions.},

We identify constrained elements from 3 bp to over 1 kbp in length, covering {$\sim$}5.5\% of the human locus. Our estimate for the total amount of nonexonic constraint experienced by this locus is roughly twice that for exonic constraint. Constrained elements tend to cluster, and we identify large constrained regions that correspond well with known functional elements. While constraint density inversely correlates with mobile element density, we also show the presence of unambiguously constrained elements overlapping mammalian ancestral repeats. In addition, we describe a number of elements in this region that have undergone intense purifying selection throughout mammalian evolution, and we show that these important elements are more numerous than previously thought. These results were obtained with Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP), a statistically rigorous and biologically transparent framework for constrained element identification. GERP identifies regions at high resolution that exhibit nucleotide substitution deficits, and measures these deficits as ``rejected substitutions.'' Rejected substitutions reflect the intensity of past purifying selection and are used to rank and characterize constrained elements. We anticipate that GERP and the types of analyses it facilitates will provide further insights and improved annotation for the human genome as mammalian genome sequence data become richer.},

  abstract = {Inbreeding depression, the reduction in fitness that accompanies inbreeding, is one of the most important topics of research in evolutionary and conservation genetics. In the recent literature, much attention has been paid to the possibility of purging the genetic load. If inbreeding depression is due to deleterious alleles, whose effect on fitness are negative when in a homozygous state, then successive generations of inbreeding may result in a rebound in fitness due to the selective decrease in frequency of deleterious alleles. Here we examine the experimental evidence for purging of the genetic load by collating empirical tests of rebounds in fitness-related traits with inbreeding in animals and plants. We gathered data from 28 studies including five mammal, three insect, one mollusc, and 13 plant species. We tested for purging by examining three measures of fitness-component variation with serial generations of inbreeding: (1) changes in inbreeding depression, (2) changes in fitness components of inbred lines relative to the original outbred line, and (3) purged population (outcrossed inbred lines) trait means as a function of ancestral outbred trait means. Frequent and substantial purging was found using all three measures, but was particularly pronounced when tracking changes in inbreeding depression. Despite this, we found little correspondence between the three measures of purging within individual studies, indicating that the manner in which a researcher chooses to estimate purging will affect interpretation of the results obtained. The discrepancy suggests an alternative hypothesis: rebounds in fitness with inbreeding may have resulted from adaptation to laboratory conditions and not to purging when using outcrossed inbred lines. However, the pronounced reduction in inbreeding depression for a number of studies provides evidence for purging, as the measure is likely less affected by selection for laboratory conditions. Unlike other taxonspecific reviews on this topic, our results provide support for the purging hypothesis, but firm predictions about the situations in which purging is likely or the magnitude of fitness rebound possible when populations are inbred remain difficult. Further research is required to resolve the discrepancy between the results obtained using different experimental approaches.},

One way of detecting constrained elements is to follow a bottom-up approach by computing constraint scores for individual positions of a multiple alignment and then defining constrained elements as segments of contiguous, highly scoring nucleotide positions. Here we present GERP++, a new tool that uses maximum likelihood evolutionary rate estimation for position-specific scoring and, in contrast to previous bottomup methods, a novel dynamic programming approach to subsequently define constrained elements. GERP++ evaluates a richer set of candidate element breakpoints and ranks them based on statistical significance, eliminating the need for biased heuristic extension techniques. Using GERP++ we identify over 1.3 million constrained elements spanning over 7\% of the human genome. We predict a higher fraction than earlier estimates largely due to the annotation of longer constrained elements, which improves one to one correspondence between predicted elements with known functional sequences. GERP++ is an efficient and effective tool to provide both nucleotide- and element-level constraint scores within deep multiple sequence alignments.},

  abstract = {Loss of function (LoF) genetic variants are predicted to disrupt gene function, and are therefore expected to substantially reduce individual's viability. Knowing the genetic burden of LoF variants in endangered species is of interest for a better understanding of the effects of declining population sizes on species viability. In this study, we have estimated the number of LoF polymorphic variants in six great ape populations, based on whole-genome sequencing data in 79 individuals. Our results show that although the number of functional variants per individual is conditioned by the effective population size, the number of variants with a drastic phenotypic effect is very similar across species. We hypothesize that for those variants with high selection coefficients, differences in effective population size are not important enough to affect the efficiency of natural selection to remove them. We also describe that mostly CpG LoF mutations are shared across species, and an accumulation of LoF variants at olfactory receptor genes in agreement with its pseudogenization in humans and other primate species.},

  abstract = {The ka ka po  is a flightless parrot endemic to New Zealand. Once common in the archipelago, only 201 individuals remain today, most of them descending from an isolated island population. We report the first genome-wide analyses of the species, including a high-quality genome assembly for ka ka po , one of the first chromosome-level reference genomes sequenced by the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). We also sequenced and analyzed 35 modern genomes from the sole surviving island population and 14 genomes from the extinct mainland population. While theory suggests that such a small population is likely to have accumulated deleterious mutations through genetic drift, our analyses on the impact of the long-term small population size in ka ka po  indicate that present-day island ka ka po  have a reduced number of harmful mutations compared to mainland individuals. We hypothesize that this reduced mutational load is due to the island population having been subjected to a combination of genetic drift and purging of deleterious mutations, through increased inbreeding and purifying selection, since its isolation from the mainland \$10,000 years ago. Our results provide evidence that small populations can survive even when isolated for hundreds of generations. This work provides key insights into ka ka po  breeding and recovery and more generally into the application of genetic tools in conservation efforts for endangered species.},

While several studies recently investigated the dynamics of deleterious mutations in wild populations, no study has yet explored the fate of deleterious mutations in a context of populations managed by supplementation. Here, based on a dataset of nine wild and 15 supplemented Lake Trout populations genotyped at 4,982 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s by means of genotype by sequencing (GBS), we explored the effect of supplementation on the frequency of putatively deleterious variants. Three main findings are consequential for the management of fish populations. First, an increase in neutral genetic diversity in stocked populations compared with unstocked ones was observed. Second, putatively deleterious mutations were more likely to be found in unstocked than in stocked populations, suggesting a lower efficiency to purge deleterious mutations in unstocked lakes. Third, a population currently used as a major source for supplementation is characterized by several fixed putatively deleterious alleles. Therefore, other source populations with lower abundance of putatively deleterious mutations should be favored as sources of supplementation. We discuss management implications of our results, especially pertaining to the joint identification of neutral and deleterious mutations that could help refining the choice of source and sink populations for supplementation in order to maximize their evolutionary potential and to limit their mutation load.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Inbreeding depression is a general phenomenon that is due mainly to recessive deleterious mutations, the so-called mutation load. It has been much studied theoretically. However, until very recently, population structure has not been taken into account, even though it can be an important factor in the evolution of populations. Population subdivision modifies the dynamics of deleterious mutations because the outcome of selection depends on processes both within populations (selection and drift) and between populations (migration). Here, we present a general model that permits us to gain insight into patterns of inbreeding depression, heterosis, and the load in subdivided populations. We show that they can be interpreted with reference to single-population theory, using an appropriate local effective population size that integrates the effects of drift, selection, and migration. We term this the ``effective population size of selection'' (NeS). For the infinite island model, for example, it is equal to NeS=N(1+m/hs), where N is the local population size, m the migration rate, and h and s the dominance and selection coefficients of deleterious mutation. Our results have implications for the estimation and interpretation of inbreeding depression in subdivided populations, especially regarding conservation issues. We also discuss the possible effects of migration and subdivision on the evolution of mating systems.},

The resulting bottlenecks have a profound impact on the genetic makeup of a species with unknown consequences for health. A key genetic factor for species survival is the evolution of deleterious mutation load, but how bottleneck strength and mutation load interact lacks empirical evidence. We analyze 60 complete genomes of six ibex species and the domestic goat. We show that historic bottlenecks rather than the current conservation status predict levels of genome-wide variation. By analyzing the exceptionally well-characterized population bottlenecks of the once nearly extinct Alpine ibex, we find genomic evidence of concurrent purging of highly deleterious mutations but accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations. This suggests that recolonization bottlenecks induced both relaxed selection and purging, thus reshaping the landscape of deleterious mutation load. Our findings highlight that even populations of \textasciitilde 1000 individuals can accumulate mildly deleterious mutations. Conservation efforts should focus on preventing population declines below such levels to ensure long-term survival of species.},

We characterize the distribution of deleterious mutations among diverse human populations, modeled under different selection coefficients and dominance parameters. Using a new dataset of diverse human genomes from seven different populations, we use spatially explicit simulations to reveal that classes of deleterious alleles have very different patterns across populations, reflecting the interaction between genetic drift and purifying selection. We show that there is a strong signal of purifying selection at conserved genomic positions within African populations, but most predicted deleterious mutations have evolved as if they were neutral during the expansion out of Africa.           ,              The Out-of-Africa (OOA) dispersal {$\sim$}50,000 y ago is characterized by a series of founder events as modern humans expanded into multiple continents. Population genetics theory predicts an increase of mutational load in populations undergoing serial founder effects during range expansions. To test this hypothesis, we have sequenced full genomes and high-coverage exomes from seven geographically divergent human populations from Namibia, Congo, Algeria, Pakistan, Cambodia, Siberia, and Mexico. We find that individual genomes vary modestly in the overall number of predicted deleterious alleles. We show via spatially explicit simulations that the observed distribution of deleterious allele frequencies is consistent with the OOA dispersal, particularly under a model where deleterious mutations are recessive. We conclude that there is a strong signal of purifying selection at conserved genomic positions within Africa, but that many predicted deleterious mutations have evolved as if they were neutral during the expansion out of Africa. Under a model where selection is inversely related to dominance, we show that OOA populations are likely to have a higher mutation load due to increased allele frequencies of nearly neutral variants that are recessive or partially recessive.},

  abstract = {Reintroductions of threatened species are increasingly common in conservation. The translocation of a small subset of individuals from a genetically diverse source population could potentially lead to substantial inbreeding depression due to the high genetic load of the parent population. We analysed 12 years of data from the reintroduced population of North Island robins Petroica longipes on Tiritiri Matangi Island, New Zealand, to determine the frequency of inbreeding and magnitude of inbreeding depression. The initial breeding population consisted of 12 females and 21 males, which came from a large mainland population of robins. The frequency of mating between relatives (f40; 39\%, n =82 pairs) and close relatives (f = 0.25; 6.1\%) and the average level of inbreeding (f = 0.027) were within the range reported for other small island populations of birds. The average level of inbreeding fluctuated from year to year depending on the frequency of close inbreeding (e.g. sib\textendash sib pairs). We found evidence for inbreeding depression in juvenile survival, with survival probability estimated to decline from 31\% among non-inbred birds (f = 0) to 11\% in highly inbred juveniles (f= 0.25). The estimated number of lethal equivalents based on this relationship (4.14) was moderate compared with values reported for other island populations of passerines. Given that significant loss of fitness was only evident in highly inbred individuals, and such individuals were relatively rare once the population expanded above 30 pairs, we conclude that inbreeding depression should have little influence on this robin population. Although the future fitness consequences of any loss of genetic variation due to inbreeding are uncertain, the immediate impact of inbreeding depression is likely to be low in any reintroduced population that expands relatively quickly after establishment.},

  abstract = {Adaptation is central to population persistence in the face of environmental change, yet we seldom precisely understand the origin and spread of adaptive variation in natural populations. Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) along the Pacific Northwest coast have evolved brown winter camouflage through positive selection on recessive variation at the Agouti pigmentation gene introgressed from black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus). Here, we combine new and published whole-genome and exome sequences with targeted genotyping of Agouti to investigate the evolutionary history of local seasonal camouflage adaptation in the Pacific Northwest. We find evidence of significantly elevated inbreeding and mutational load in coastal winter-brown hares, consistent with a recent range expansion into temperate coastal environments that incurred indirect fitness costs. The genome-wide distribution of introgression tract lengths supports a pulse of hybridization near the end of the last glacial maximum, which may have facilitated range expansion via introgression of winter-brown camouflage variation. However, signatures of a selective sweep at Agouti indicate a much more recent spread of winter-brown camouflage. Through simulations, we show that the delay between the hybrid origin and subsequent selective sweep of the recessive winterbrown allele can be largely attributed to the limits of natural selection imposed by simple allelic dominance. We argue that while hybridization during periods of environmental change may provide a critical reservoir of adaptive variation at range edges, the probability and pace of local adaptation will strongly depend on population demography and the genetic architecture of introgressed variation.},

  abstract = {It is known that the allele ancestral to the variation at a polymorphic site cannot be assigned with certainty, and that the most frequently used method to assign the ancestral state\textemdash maximum parsimony\textemdash is prone to misinference. Estimates of counts of sites that have a certain number of copies of the derived allele in a sample (the unfolded site frequency spectrum, uSFS) made by parsimony are therefore also biased. We previously developed a maximum likelihood method to estimate the uSFS for a focal species using information from two outgroups while assuming simple models of nucleotide substitution. Here, we extend this approach to allow multiple outgroups (implemented for three outgroups), potentially any phylogenetic tree topology, and more complex models of nucleotide substitution. We find, however, that two outgroups and the Kimura two-parameter model are adequate for uSFS inference in most cases. We show that using parsimony to infer the ancestral state at a specific site seriously breaks down in two situations. The first is where the outgroups provide no information about the ancestral state of variation in the focal species. In this case, nucleotide variation will be underestimated if such sites are excluded. The second is where the minor allele in the focal species agrees with the allelic state of the outgroups. In this situation, parsimony tends to overestimate the probability of the major allele being derived, because it fails to account for the fact that sites with a high frequency of the derived allele tend to be rare. We present a method that corrects this deficiency and is capable of providing nearly unbiased estimates of ancestral state probabilities on a site-by-site basis and the uSFS.},

  abstract = {It is known that the allele ancestral to the variation at a polymorphic site cannot be assigned with certainty, and that the most frequently used method to assign the ancestral state\textemdash maximum parsimony\textemdash is prone to misinference. Estimates of counts of sites that have a certain number of copies of the derived allele in a sample (the unfolded site frequency spectrum, uSFS) made by parsimony are therefore also biased. We previously developed a maximum likelihood method to estimate the uSFS for a focal species using information from two outgroups while assuming simple models of nucleotide substitution. Here, we extend this approach to allow multiple outgroups (implemented for three outgroups), potentially any phylogenetic tree topology, and more complex models of nucleotide substitution. We find, however, that two outgroups and the Kimura two-parameter model are adequate for uSFS inference in most cases. We show that using parsimony to infer the ancestral state at a specific site seriously breaks down in two situations. The first is where the outgroups provide no information about the ancestral state of variation in the focal species. In this case, nucleotide variation will be underestimated if such sites are excluded. The second is where the minor allele in the focal species agrees with the allelic state of the outgroups. In this situation, parsimony tends to overestimate the probability of the major allele being derived, because it fails to account for the fact that sites with a high frequency of the derived allele tend to be rare. We present a method that corrects this deficiency and is capable of providing nearly unbiased estimates of ancestral state probabilities on a site-by-site basis and the uSFS.},

  abstract = {Significance             Habitat fragmentation is sequestering species into small and isolated populations, with high chances of extinction. Are small and isolated populations at risk for extinction from inbreeding depression? Or does inbreeding and purging of deleterious alleles reduce such threat? Using whole genomes from several wild Indian tiger populations, we provide evidence supporting purging of highly deleterious variants in a small\textendash isolated population. However, our analyses also indicate that the remaining highly deleterious alleles are at high frequencies, suggesting continued inbreeding depression despite some successful purging. We discuss the implications of our results for conservation, including possible genomics-informed genetic rescue strategies.           ,                             Increasing habitat fragmentation leads to wild populations becoming small, isolated, and threatened by inbreeding depression. However, small populations may be able to purge recessive deleterious alleles as they become expressed in homozygotes, thus reducing inbreeding depression and increasing population viability. We used whole-genome sequences from 57 tigers to estimate individual inbreeding and mutation load in a small\textendash isolated and two large\textendash connected populations in India. As expected, the small\textendash isolated population had substantially higher average genomic inbreeding (               F               ROH               = 0.57) than the large\textendash connected (               F               ROH               = 0.35 and               F               ROH               = 0.46) populations. The small\textendash isolated population had the lowest loss-of-function mutation load, likely due to purging of highly deleterious recessive mutations. The large populations had lower missense mutation loads than the small\textendash isolated population, but were not identical, possibly due to different demographic histories. While the number of the loss-of-function alleles in the small\textendash isolated population was lower, these alleles were at higher frequencies and homozygosity than in the large populations. Together, our data and analyses provide evidence of 1) high mutation load, 2) purging, and 3) the highest predicted inbreeding depression, despite purging, in the small\textendash isolated population. Frequency distributions of damaging and neutral alleles uncover genomic evidence that purifying selection has removed part of the mutation load across Indian tiger populations. These results provide genomic evidence for purifying selection in both small and large populations, but also suggest that the remaining deleterious alleles may have inbreeding-associated fitness costs. We suggest that genetic rescue from sources selected based on genome-wide differentiation could offset any possible impacts of inbreeding depression.},

To solve this problem, we modified the standard seed-and-extend approach (e.g., BLAST) to use adaptive seeds. Adaptive seeds are matches that are chosen based on their rareness, instead of using fixed-length matches. This method guarantees that the number of matches, and thus the running time, increases linearly, instead of quadratically, with sequence length. LAST, our open source implementation of adaptive seeds, enables fast and sensitive comparison of large sequences with arbitrarily nonuniform composition.},

  abstract = {We study the effects of a population bottleneck on the inbreeding depression and genetic load caused by deleterious mutations in an outcrossing population. The calculations assume that loci have multiplicative fitness effects and that linkage disequilibrium is negligible. Inbreeding depression decreases immediately after a sudden reduction of population size, but the drop is at most only several percentage points, even for severe bottlenecks. Highly recessive mutations experience a purging process that causes inbreeding depression to decline for a number of additional generations. On the basis of available parameter estimates, the absolute fall in inbreeding depression may often be only a few percentage points for bottlenecks of 10 or more individuals. With a very high lethal mutation rate and a very slow population growth, however, the decline may be on the order of 25\%. We examine when purging might favor a switch from outbreeding to selfing and find it occurs only under very limited conditions unless population growth is very slow. In contrast to inbreeding depression, a bottleneck causes an immediate increase in the genetic load. Purging causes the load to decline and then overshoot its equilibrium value. The changes are typically modest: the absolute increase in the total genetic load will be at most a few percentage points for bottlenecks of size 10 or more unless the lethal mutation rate is very high and the population growth rate very slow.},

Here we apply a genomic approach to study differences in the burden of deleterious alleles between the endangered Iberian lynx (               Lynx pardinus               ) and the widespread Eurasian lynx (               Lynx lynx               ). Our analysis unveils a significantly lower deleterious burden in the former species that should be ascribed to genetic purging, that is, to the increased opportunities of selection against recessive homozygotes due to the inbreeding caused by its smaller population size, as illustrated by our analytical predictions. This research provides theoretical and empirical evidence on the evolutionary relevance of genetic purging under certain demographic conditions.                        ,              Deleterious mutations continuously accumulate in populations, building up a burden that can threaten their survival, particularly in small populations when inbreeding exposes recessive deleterious effects. Notwithstanding, this process also triggers genetic purging, which can reduce the deleterious burden and mitigate fitness inbreeding depression. Here, we analyzed 20 whole genomes from the endangered Iberian lynx and 28 from the widespread Eurasian lynx, sister species which constitute a good model to study the dynamics of deleterious mutation burden under contrasting demographies, manifested in the consistently smaller population size and distribution area of the Iberian lynx. We also derived analytical predictions for the evolution of the deleterious burden following a bottleneck. We found 11\% fewer derived alleles for the more putatively deleterious missense category in the Iberian lynx than in the Eurasian lynx, which, in light of our theoretical predictions, should be ascribed to historical purging. No signs of purging were found in centromeres nor in the X chromosome, where selection against recessive deleterious alleles is less affected by demography. The similar deleterious burden levels for conspecific populations despite their contrasting recent demographies also point to sustained differences in historical population sizes since species divergence as the main driver of the augmented purging in the Iberian lynx. Beyond adding to the ongoing debate on the relationship between deleterious burden and population size, and on the impact of genetic factors in endangered species viability, this work contributes a whole-genome catalog of deleterious variants, which may become a valuable resource for future conservation efforts.},

All are among the world's rarest and most endangered primates. However, the genomic impact associated with their population decline remains unknown. We analyzed population genomic data of all five snub-nosed monkey species to assess their genetic diversity, inbreeding level, and genetic load. For               R. roxellana, R. bieti               , and               R. strykeri               , population size is positively correlated with genetic diversity and negatively correlated with levels of inbreeding. Other species, however, which possess small population sizes, such as               R. brelichi               and               R. avunculus               , show high levels of genetic diversity and low levels of genomic inbreeding. Similarly, in the three populations of               R. roxellana               , the Shennongjia population, which possesses the lowest population size, displays a higher level of genetic diversity and lower level of genomic inbreeding. These findings suggest that although               R. brelichi               and               R. avunculus               and the Shennongjia population might be at risk, it possess significant genetic diversity and could thus help strengthen their long-term survival potential. Intriguingly,               R. roxellana               with large population size possess high genetic diversity and low level of genetic load, but they show the highest recent inbreeding level compared with the other snub-nosed monkeys. This suggests that, despite its large population size,               R. roxellana               has likely been experiencing recent inbreeding, which has not yet affected its mutational load and fitness. Analyses of homozygous-derived deleterious mutations identified in all snub-nosed monkey species indicate that these mutations are affecting immune, especially in smaller population sizes, indicating that the long-term consequences of inbreeding may be resulting in an overall reduction of immune capability in the snub-nosed monkeys, which could provide a dramatic effect on their long-term survival prospects. Altogether, our study provides valuable information concerning the genomic impact of population decline of the snub-nosed monkeys. We revealed multiple counterintuitive and unexpected patterns of genetic diversity in small and large population, which will be essential for conservation management of these endangered species.},

The distributions of ROH in 199 accessions representing Asian pears (45), European pears (109), and interspecific hybrids (45) were investigated using genotyping-by-sequencing in this study. Fruit phenotypes including fruit weight, firmness, Brix, titratable acidity, and flavor volatiles were measured for genotype-phenotype analyses. The average number of ROH and the average total genomic length of ROH were 6 and 11 Mb, respectively, in Asian accessions, and 13 and 30 Mb, respectively, in European accessions. Significant associations between genomic inbreeding coefficients (FROH) and phenotypes were observed for 23 out of 32 traits analyzed. An overlap between ROH islands and significant markers from genome-wide association analyses was observed. Previously published quantitative trait loci for fruit traits and disease resistances also overlapped with some of the ROH islands. A prominent ROH island at the bottom of linkage group 17 overlapped with a recombination-supressed genomic region harboring the self-incompatibility locus. The observed ROH patterns suggested that systematic breeding of European pears would have started earlier than of Asian pears. Our research suggest that FROH would serve as a novel tool for managing inbreeding in gene-banks of self-incompatible plant species. ROH mapping provides a complementary strategy to unravel the genetic architecture of complex traits, and to evaluate differential selection in outbred plants. This seminal work would provide foundation for the ROH research in self-incompatible plants.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Many wild species have suffered drastic population size declines over the past centuries, which have led to `genomic erosion' processes characterized by reduced genetic diversity, increased inbreeding, and accumulation of harmful muta-tions. Yet, genomic erosion estimates of modern-day populations often lack concord-ance with dwindling population sizes and conservation status of threatened species. One way to directly quantify the genomic consequences of population declines is to compare genome-wide data from pre-decline museum samples and modern samples. However, doing so requires computational data processing and analysis tools specifi-cally adapted to comparative analyses of degraded, ancient or historical, DNA data with modern DNA data as well as personnel trained to perform such analyses. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Here, we present a highly flexible, scalable, and modular pipeline to compare patterns of genomic erosion using samples from disparate time periods. The GenErode pipeline uses state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools to simultaneously process wholegenome re-sequencing data from ancient/historical and modern samples, and to produce comparable estimates of several genomic erosion indices. No programming knowledge is required to run the pipeline and all bioinformatic steps are well-docu-mented, making the pipeline accessible to users with different backgrounds. GenErode is written in Snakemake and Python3 and uses Conda and Singularity containers to achieve reproducibility on high-performance compute clusters. The source code is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/NBISweden/GenErode). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} GenErode is a user-friendly and reproducible pipeline that enables the standardization of genomic erosion indices from temporally sampled whole genome re-sequencing data.},

  abstract = {Continuous inbreeding exposes deleterious recessive alleles to selection and can thereby lead to partial purging of the genetic load and reduced inbreeding depression. Purging has been well documented in experimental laboratory populations, but evidence of reduced inbreeding depression due to purging in wild populations is largely lacking. This study examines the inbreeding load associated with juvenile survival at a protected island site of a bottlenecked population of the Stewart Island robin Petroica australis rakiura. Based on a complete pedigree of the island population, we found little evidence that inbreeding coefficients explained any additional variation in juvenile survival, once demographic factors such as the effects of density, timing of fledging and age of mother were taken into account. Lethal equivalents, a standardized measure of the strength of inbreeding depression, were close to zero (B= 0.24, 95\% CI=\`A1.92\textendash 1.04, n= 326) and lower than that documented for an island population of a widespread congener (B= 6.71, 95\% CI=\`A0.66\textendash 14.08, n= 238) and for several other species for which significant inbreeding depression was detected (B= 1.30\textendash 7.47). There are several reasons as to why studies can fail to detect pedigree-based inbreeding depression in wild populations, but evidence presented here of low lethal equivalents and relatively high survival of both inbred and non-inbred juveniles are consistent with a population that has undergone partial purging of its genetic load during historical population bottlenecks. Although our study does not imply a complete absence of inbreeding depression, it is one of the first studies of a wild population where weak inbreeding depression for juvenile survival appears to be associated with a prolonged bottleneck.},

Island species usually have lower census population sizes (N) than continental species and, supposedly, lower effective population sizes (Ne). Given that both the rates of change caused by genetic drift and by selection are dependent upon Ne, island species are theoretically expected to exhibit (1) lower genetic diversity, (2) less effective natural selection against slightly deleterious mutations,3,4 and (3) a lower rate of adaptive evolution.5\textendash 8 Here, we have used a large set of newly sequenced and published whole-genome sequences of Passerida species (14 insular and 11 continental) to test these predictions. We confirm that island species exhibit lower census size and Ne, supporting the hypothesis that the smaller area available on islands constrains the upper bound of Ne. In the insular species, we find lower nucleotide diversity in coding regions, higher ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphisms, and lower adaptive substitution rates. Our results provide robust evidence that the lower Ne experienced by island species has affected both the ability of natural selection to efficiently remove weakly deleterious mutations and also the adaptive potential of island species, therefore providing considerable empirical support for the nearly neutral theory. We discuss the implications for both evolutionary and conservation biology.},

  abstract = {Significance             Dogs have an integral role in human society, and recent evidence suggests they have a unique bond that elicits a beneficial hormonal response in both dogs and human handlers. Here, we show this relationship has a dark side. Small population size during domestication and strong artificial selection for breed-defining traits has unintentionally increased the numbers of deleterious genetic variants. Our findings question the overly typological practice of breeding individuals that best fit breed standards, a Victorian legacy. This practice does not allow selection to remove potentially deleterious variation associated with genes responsible for breed-specific traits.           ,              Population bottlenecks, inbreeding, and artificial selection can all, in principle, influence levels of deleterious genetic variation. However, the relative importance of each of these effects on genome-wide patterns of deleterious variation remains controversial. Domestic and wild canids offer a powerful system to address the role of these factors in influencing deleterious variation because their history is dominated by known bottlenecks and intense artificial selection. Here, we assess genome-wide patterns of deleterious variation in 90 whole-genome sequences from breed dogs, village dogs, and gray wolves. We find that the ratio of amino acid changing heterozygosity to silent heterozygosity is higher in dogs than in wolves and, on average, dogs have 2\textendash 3\% higher genetic load than gray wolves. Multiple lines of evidence indicate this pattern is driven by less efficient natural selection due to bottlenecks associated with domestication and breed formation, rather than recent inbreeding. Further, we find regions of the genome implicated in selective sweeps are enriched for amino acid changing variants and Mendelian disease genes. To our knowledge, these results provide the first quantitative estimates of the increased burden of deleterious variants directly associated with domestication and have important implications for selective breeding programs and the conservation of rare and endangered species. Specifically, they highlight the costs associated with selective breeding and question the practice favoring the breeding of individuals that best fit breed standards. Our results also suggest that maintaining a large population size, rather than just avoiding inbreeding, is a critical factor for preventing the accumulation of deleterious variants.},

Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are contiguous lengths of homozygous segments of the genome where the two haplotypes inherited from the parents are identical. Here, we investigated the occurrence and distribution of ROH using a medium-dense SNP panel to characterize autozygosity in 516 Valle del Belice sheep and to identify the genomic regions with high ROH frequencies. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We identified 11,629 ROH and all individuals displayed at least one ROH longer than 1 Mb. The mean value of F estimated from ROH longer than1 Mb was 0.084 {$\pm$} 0.061. ROH that were shorter than 10 Mb predominated. The highest and lowest coverages of Ovis aries chromosomes (OAR) by ROH were on OAR24 and OAR1, respectively. The number of ROH per chromosome length displayed a specific pattern, with higher values for the first three chromosomes. Both number of ROH and length of the genome covered by ROH varied considerably between animals. Two hundred and thirty-nine SNPs were considered as candidate markers that may be under directional selection and we identified 107 potential candidate genes. Six genomic regions located on six chromosomes, corresponding to ROH islands, are presented as hotspots of autozygosity, which frequently coincided with regions of medium recombination rate. According to the KEGG database, most of these genes were involved in multiple signaling and signal transduction pathways in a wide variety of cellular and biochemical processes. A genome scan revealed the presence of ROH islands in genomic regions that harbor candidate genes for selection in response to environmental stress and which underlie local adaptation. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} These results suggest that natural selection has, at least partially, a role in shaping the genome of Valle del Belice sheep and that ROH in the ovine genome may help to detect genomic regions involved in the determinism of traits under selection.},

We are interested in how the variation captured in protein-\-coding genes fluctuates relative to overall genomic diversity and whether smaller populations suffer greater costs due to their genetic load of deleterious mutations compared with larger populations. We analyzed individual whole-\-genome sequences (N = 74) from three different populations of Montezuma quail (Cyrtonyx montezumae), a small ground-\-dwelling bird that is sustainably harvested in some portions of its range but is of conservation concern elsewhere. Our historical demographic results indicate that Montezuma quail populations in the United States exhibit low levels of genomic diversity due in large part to long-\-term declines in effective population sizes over nearly a million years. The smaller and more isolated Texas population is significantly more inbred than the large Arizona and the intermediate-\-sized New Mexico populations we surveyed. The Texas gene pool has a significantly smaller proportion of strongly deleterious variants segregating in the population compared with the larger Arizona gene pool. Our results demonstrate that even in small populations, highly deleterious mutations are effectively purged and/or lost due to drift. However, we find that in small populations the realized genetic load is elevated because of inbreeding coupled with a higher frequency of slightly deleterious mutations that are manifested in homozygotes. Overall, our study illustrates how population genomics can be used to proactively assess both neutral and functional aspects of contemporary genetic diversity in a conservation framework while simultaneously considering deeper demographic histories.},

  abstract = {Domestication has changed the natural evolutionary trajectory of horses by favoring the reproduction of a limited number of animals showing traits of interest. Reduced breeding stocks hampered the elimination of deleterious variants by means of negative selection, ultimately inflating mutational loads. However, ancient genomics revealed that mutational loads remained steady during most of the domestication history until a sudden burst took place some 250 years ago. To identify the factors underlying this trajectory, we gather an extensive dataset consisting of 175 modern and 153 ancient genomes previously published, and carry out the most comprehensive characterization of deleterious mutations in horses. We confirm that deleterious variants segregated at low frequencies during the last 3500 years, and only spread and incremented their occurrence in the homozygous state during modern times, owing to inbreeding. This independently happened in multiple breeds, following both the development of closed studs and purebred lines, and the deprecation of horsepower in the 20th century, which brought many draft breeds close to extinction. Our work illustrates the paradoxical effect of some conservation and improvement programs, which reduced the overall genomic fitness and viability.},

  abstract = {The genetic consequences of population bottlenecks on patterns of deleterious genetic variation in human populations are of tremendous interest. Based on exome sequencing of 18 Greenlandic Inuit we show that the Inuit have undergone a severe  20,000-year-long bottleneck. This has led to a markedly more extreme distribution of allele frequencies than seen for any other human population tested to date, making the Inuit the perfect population for investigating the effect of a bottleneck on patterns of deleterious variation. When comparing proxies for genetic load that assume an additive effect of deleterious alleles, the Inuit show, at most, a slight increase in load compared to European, East Asian, and African populations. Specifically, we observe ,4\% increase in the number of derived deleterious alleles in the Inuit. In contrast, proxies for genetic load under a recessive model suggest that the Inuit have a significantly higher load (20\% increase or more) compared to other less bottlenecked human populations. Forward simulations under realistic models of demography support our empirical findings, showing up to a 6\% increase in the genetic load for the Inuit population across all models of dominance. Further, the Inuit population carries fewer deleterious variants than other human populations, but those that are present tend to be at higher frequency than in other populations. Overall, our results show how recent demographic history has affected patterns of deleterious variants in human populations.},

  abstract = {Methods for detecting nucleotide substitution rates that are faster or slower than expected under neutral drift are widely used to identify candidate functional elements in genomic sequences. However, most existing methods consider either reductions (conservation) or increases (acceleration) in rate but not both, or assume that selection acts uniformly across the branches of a phylogeny. Here we examine the more general problem of detecting departures from the neutral rate of substitution in either direction, possibly in a clade-specific manner. We consider four statistical, phylogenetic tests for addressing this problem: a likelihood ratio test, a score test, a test based on exact distributions of numbers of substitutions, and the genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) test. All four tests have been implemented in a freely available program called phyloP. Based on extensive simulation experiments, these tests are remarkably similar in statistical power. With 36 mammalian species, they all appear to be capable of fairly good sensitivity with low false-positive rates in detecting strong selection at individual nucleotides, moderate selection in 3-bp elements, and weaker or clade-specific selection in longer elements. By applying phyloP to mammalian multiple alignments from the ENCODE project, we shed light on patterns of conservation/acceleration in known and predicted functional elements, approximate fractions of sites subject to constraint, and differences in clade-specific selection in the primate and glires clades. We also describe new ``Conservation'' tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser that display both phyloP and phastCons scores for genome-wide alignments of 44 vertebrate species.},

  abstract = {In cases of severe wildlife population decline, a key question is whether recovery efforts will be impeded by genetic factors, such as inbreeding depression. Decades of excess mortality from gillnet fishing have driven Mexico's vaquita porpoise (               Phocoena sinus               ) to \textasciitilde 10 remaining individuals. We analyzed whole-genome sequences from 20 vaquitas and integrated genomic and demographic information into stochastic, individual-based simulations to quantify the species' recovery potential. Our analysis suggests that the vaquita's historical rarity has resulted in a low burden of segregating deleterious variation, reducing the risk of inbreeding depression. Similarly, genome-informed simulations suggest that the vaquita can recover if bycatch mortality is immediately halted. This study provides hope for vaquitas and other naturally rare endangered species and highlights the utility of genomics in predicting extinction risk.                        ,              Population size and risk of extinction                            The vaquita porpoise is one of the most endangered animals in the world, with only an estimated 10 individuals remaining. To determine the risk of extinction caused by inbreeding depression, Robinson               et al               . sequenced and examined 20 vaquita genomes to determine their heterozygosity and ancestral population size (see the Perspective by Grueber and Sunnucks). The authors determined that the long-term population size of vaquitas has been low for a marine mammal, with approximately 1000 years of stable genomic diversity. Genomic comparisons with other cetacean species and modeling indicated that vaquitas are unlikely to suffer from inbreeding depression. Therefore, if the risk of bycatch mortality caused by fishermen can be eliminated, then there is a chance that this species will not go extinct. \textemdash LMZ                        ,              Genomic and population viability analyses suggest that the vaquita porpoise is not doomed to extinction.},

Much less attention is directed at understanding the landscape of deleterious variation, an insidious consequence of geographic isolation and the inefficiency of natural selection to eliminate harmful variants in small populations [3\textendash 5]. With population sizes of many vertebrates decreasing and isolation increasing through habitat fragmentation and loss, understanding the extent and nature of deleterious variation in small populations is essential for predicting and enhancing population persistence. The Channel Island fox (Urocyon littoralis) is a dwarfed species that inhabits six of California's Channel Islands and is derived from the mainland gray fox (U. cinereoargenteus). These isolated island populations have persisted for thousands of years at extremely small population sizes [6, 7] and, consequently, are a model for testing ideas about the accumulation of deleterious variation in small populations under natural conditions. Analysis of complete genome sequence data from island foxes shows a dramatic decrease in genome-wide variation and a sharp increase in the homozygosity of deleterious variants. The San Nicolas Island population has a near absence of variation, demonstrating a unique genetic flatlining that is punctuated by heterozygosity hotspots, enriched for olfactory receptor genes and other genes with high levels of ancestral variation. These findings question the generality of the small-population paradigm that maintains substantial genetic variation is necessary for short- and long-term persistence.},

  abstract = {Significance             Meiotic recombination is known to vary over 1,000-fold in many eukaryotic organisms, including maize. This regional genomic variation has enormous consequences for plant breeders, who rely on meiotic cross-overs to fine-map quantitative traits and introgress favorable alleles. Deleterious mutations are also predicted to accumulate preferentially within low-recombination regions, particularly within historically outcrossing species, such as maize. Here, we show that meiotic recombination is predictable across diverse crosses based on several genomic features of the reference genome. We demonstrate that the extant patterns of recombination are historically stable and tied to variation in the number of deleterious mutations. The ability of plant breeders to exploit recombination to purge segregating deleterious alleles will determine the efficacy of future crop improvement.           ,              Among the fundamental evolutionary forces, recombination arguably has the largest impact on the practical work of plant breeders. Varying over 1,000-fold across the maize genome, the local meiotic recombination rate limits the resolving power of quantitative trait mapping and the precision of favorable allele introgression. The consequences of low recombination also theoretically extend to the species-wide scale by decreasing the power of selection relative to genetic drift, and thereby hindering the purging of deleterious mutations. In this study, we used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to identify 136,000 recombination breakpoints at high resolution within US and Chinese maize nested association mapping populations. We find that the pattern of cross-overs is highly predictable on the broad scale, following the distribution of gene density and CpG methylation. Several large inversions also suppress recombination in distinct regions of several families. We also identify recombination hotspots ranging in size from 1 kb to 30 kb. We find these hotspots to be historically stable and, compared with similar regions with low recombination, to have strongly differentiated patterns of DNA methylation and GC content. We also provide evidence for the historical action of GC-biased gene conversion in recombination hotspots. Finally, using genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) to identify putative deleterious polymorphisms, we find evidence for reduced genetic load in hotspot regions, a phenomenon that may have considerable practical importance for breeding programs worldwide.},

  abstract = {Significance             The domestication of the horse revolutionized warfare, trade, and the exchange of people and ideas. This at least 5,500-y-long process, which ultimately transformed wild horses into the hundreds of breeds living today, is difficult to reconstruct from archeological data and modern genetics alone. We therefore sequenced two complete horse genomes, predating domestication by thousands of years, to characterize the genetic footprint of domestication. These ancient genomes reveal predomestic population structure and a significant fraction of genetic variation shared with the domestic breeds but absent from Przewalski's horses. We find positive selection on genes involved in various aspects of locomotion, physiology, and cognition. Finally, we show that modern horse genomes contain an excess of deleterious mutations, likely representing the genetic cost of domestication.           ,              The domestication of the horse {$\sim$}5.5 kya and the emergence of mounted riding, chariotry, and cavalry dramatically transformed human civilization. However, the genetics underlying horse domestication are difficult to reconstruct, given the near extinction of wild horses. We therefore sequenced two ancient horse genomes from Taymyr, Russia (at 7.4- and 24.3-fold coverage), both predating the earliest archeological evidence of domestication. We compared these genomes with genomes of domesticated horses and the wild Przewalski's horse and found genetic structure within Eurasia in the Late Pleistocene, with the ancient population contributing significantly to the genetic variation of domesticated breeds. We furthermore identified a conservative set of 125 potential domestication targets using four complementary scans for genes that have undergone positive selection. One group of genes is involved in muscular and limb development, articular junctions, and the cardiac system, and may represent physiological adaptations to human utilization. A second group consists of genes with cognitive functions, including social behavior, learning capabilities, fear response, and agreeableness, which may have been key for taming horses. We also found that domestication is associated with inbreeding and an excess of deleterious mutations. This genetic load is in line with the ``cost of domestication'' hypothesis also reported for rice, tomatoes, and dogs, and it is generally attributed to the relaxation of purifying selection resulting from the strong demographic bottlenecks accompanying domestication. Our work demonstrates the power of ancient genomes to reconstruct the complex genetic changes that transformed wild animals into their domesticated forms, and the population context in which this process took place.},

We used functional annotation and evolutionary conservation scores to study deleterious variation in a total of 209 genomes from both the Scandinavian and neighbouring wolf populations in northern Europe. The masked load (deleterious mutations in heterozygote state) was highest in Russia and Finland with deleterious alleles segregating at lower frequency than neutral variation. Genetic drift in the Scandinavian population led to the loss of ancestral alleles, fixation of deleterious variants and a significant increase in the per-individual realized load (deleterious mutations in homozygote state; an increase by 45\% in protein-coding genes) over five generations of inbreeding. Arrival of immigrants gave a temporary genetic rescue effect with ancestral alleles re-entering the population and thereby shifting deleterious alleles from homozygous into heterozygote genotypes. However, in the absence of permanent connectivity to Finnish and Russian populations, inbreeding has then again led to the exposure of deleterious mutations. These observations provide genome-wide insight into the magnitude of genetic load and genetic rescue at the molecular level, and in relation to population history.

  abstract = {Abstract             Pedigree information was traditionally used to assess inbreeding. The availability of high-density marker panels provides an alternative to assess inbreeding, particularly in the presence of incomplete and error-prone pedigrees. Assessment of autozygosity across chromosomal segments using runs of homozygosity (ROH) has emerged as a valuable tool to estimate inbreeding due to its general flexibility and ability to quantify the chromosomal contribution to genome-wide inbreeding. Unfortunately, the identification of ROH segments is sensitive to the parameters used during the search process. These parameters are heuristically set, leading to significant variation in the results. The minimum length required to identify an ROH segment has major effects on the estimation of inbreeding and inbreeding depression, yet it is arbitrarily set. To overcome this limitation, a search algorithm to approximate mutation enrichment was developed to determine the minimum length of ROH segments. It consists of finding genome segments with significant effect differences in trait means between animals with high and low burdens of autozygous intervals with a specific length. The minimum length could be determined heuristically as the smallest interval at which a significant signal is detected. The proposed method was tested in an inbred Hereford cattle population genotyped for 30,220 SNPs. Phenotypes recorded for six traits were used for the approximation of mutation loads. The estimated minimum length was around 1 Mb for yearling weight (YW) and average daily gain (ADG) and 4 Mb for birth weight and weaning weight. These trait-specific thresholds estimated using the proposed method could be attributed to a trait-dependent effect of homozygosity. The detection of significant inbreeding effects was well aligned with the estimated thresholds, especially for YW and ADG. Although highly deleterious alleles are expected to be more frequent in recent inbreeding (long ROH), short ROH segments (\&lt;5 Mb) could contain a large number of less deleterious mutations with substantial joint effects on some traits (YW and ADG). Our results highlight the importance of accurate estimation of the ROH-based inbreeding and the necessity to consider a trait-specific minimum length threshold for the identification of ROH segments in inbreeding depression analyses. These thresholds could be determined using the proposed method provided the availability of phenotypic information.},

One of the most extreme natural examples is the Devils Hole pupfish (               Cyprinodon diabolis               ), an iconic and critically endangered species with the smallest known range of any vertebrate. This species has experienced severe declines in population size over the last 30 years and suffered major bottlenecks in 2007 and 2013, when the population shrunk to 38 and 35 individuals, respectively. Here, we analysed 30 resequenced genomes of desert pupfishes from Death Valley, Ash Meadows and surrounding areas to examine the genomic consequences of small population size. We found extremely high levels of inbreeding (               F               ROH               = 0.34\textendash 0.81) and an increased amount of potentially deleterious genetic variation in the Devils Hole pupfish as compared to other species, including unique, fixed loss-of-function alleles and deletions in genes associated with sperm motility and hypoxia. Additionally, we successfully resequenced a formalin-fixed museum specimen from 1980 and found that the population was already highly inbred prior to recent known bottlenecks. We thus document severe inbreeding and increased mutation load in the Devils Hole pupfish and identify candidate deleterious variants to inform management of this conservation icon.},

Sexually selected traits such as ornamentation and courtship behaviour may not be primary fitness characters, but selection and dominance coefficients of their mutations will resemble those of traits under natural selection. Strong directional selection, for instance, through female mate-choice, purges all but the most recessive deleterious mutations, and the remaining dominance variation will result in inbreeding depression once populations undergo bottlenecks. We analysed the effects of inbreeding on sexually selected traits (colour pattern and courtship behaviour) in the male guppy, Poecilia reticulata, from Trinidad, and found a significant decline in the frequency of mating behaviour and colour spots. Such effects occurred although the genetic basis of these traits, many of which are Y-linked and hemizygous, would be expected to leave relatively little scope for inbreeding depression. Findings suggest that these sexually selected traits could reflect the genetic condition or health of males, and thus may be informative mate-cue characters for female choice as suggested by the `good genes' model.},

Here, we analyse 5 historical and 16 modern genomes from these populations to investigate the genomic consequences of the recent decline, such as increased inbreeding and mutational load. We find that the Malay Peninsula population experienced increased inbreeding shortly before extirpation, which possibly was accompanied by purging. The populations on Sumatra and Borneo instead show low inbreeding, but high mutational load. The currently small population sizes may thus in the near future lead to inbreeding depression. Moreover, we find little evidence for differences in local adaptation among populations, suggesting that future inbreeding depression could potentially be mitigated by assisted gene flow among populations.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The subdivision of a species into local populations causes its response to selection to change, even if selection is uniform across space. Population structure increases the frequency of homozygotes and therefore makes selection on homozygous effects more effective. However, population subdivision can increase the probability of competition among relatives, which may reduce the efficacy of selection. As a result, the response to selection can be either increased or decreased in a subdivided population relative to an undivided one, depending on the dominance coefficient FST and whether selection is hard or soft. Realistic levels of population structure tend to reduce the mean frequency of deleterious alleles. The mutation load tends to be decreased in a subdivided population for recessive alleles, as does the expected inbreeding depression. The magnitude of the effects of population subdivision tends to be greatest in species with hard selection rather than soft selection. Population structure can play an important role in determining the mean fitness of populations at equilibrium between mutation and selection.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Alignments of multiple genomes are a cornerstone of comparative genomics, but generating these alignments remains technically challenging and often impractical. We developed the             msa\_pipeline             workflow (             https://bitbucket.org/bucklerlab/msa\_pipeline             ) based on the LAST aligner to allow practical and sensitive multiple alignment of diverged plant genomes with minimal user inputs. Our workflow only requires a set of genomes in FASTA format as input. The workflow outputs multiple alignments in MAF format, and includes utilities to help calculate genome-wide conservation scores. As high repeat content and genomic divergence are substantial challenges in plant genome alignment, we also explored the impact of different masking approaches and alignment parameters using genome assemblies of 33 grass species. Compared to conventional masking with RepeatMasker, a             k             -mer masking approach increased the alignment rate of CDS and non-coding functional regions by 25\% and 14\% respectively. We further found that default alignment parameters generally perform well, but parameter tuning can increase the alignment rate for non-coding functional regions by over 52\% compared to default LAST settings. Finally, by increasing alignment sensitivity from the default baseline, parameter tuning can increase the number of non-coding sites that can be scored for conservation by over 76\%.},

  abstract = {Characterizing inbreeding depression in wildlife populations can be critical to their conservation. Coefficients of individual inbreeding can be estimated from genomewide marker data. The degree to which sensitivity of inbreeding coefficients to population genetic substructure alters estimates of inbreeding depression in wild populations is not well understood. Using generalized linear models, we tested the power of two frequently used inbreeding coefficients that are calculated from genome-wide SNP markers, FH and F\^III, to predict four fitness traits estimated over two decades in an isolated population of the critically endangered Leadbeater's possum. FH estimates inbreeding as excess observed homozygotes relative to equilibrium expectations, whereas F\^III quantifies allelic similarity between the gametes that formed an individual, and upweights rare homozygotes. We estimated FH and F\^III from 1,575 genome-wide SNP loci in individuals with fitness trait data (N = 179\textendash 237 per trait), and computed revised coefficients, FHby group and F\^IIIby group, adjusted for population genetic substructure by calculating them separately within two different genetic groups of individuals identified in the population. Using FH or F\^III in the models, inbreeding depression was detected for survival to sexual maturity, longevity and whether individuals bred during their lifetime. F\^IIIby group (but not FHby group) additionally revealed significant inbreeding depression for lifetime reproductive output (total offspring assigned to each individual). Estimates of numbers of lethal equivalents indicated substantial inbreeding load, but differing between inbreeding estimators. Inbreeding depression, declining population size, and low and declining genetic diversity suggest that genetic rescue may assist in preventing extinction of this unique Leadbeater's possum population.},
