title: "Genetic Load"

# Introduction

Genetic load can be defined as a statistic that summarizes the selection and dominance coefficients of deleterious mutations as a function of their frequencies in a population [@bertorelleGeneticLoadGenomic2022].

There are different types of load, e.g. the realized load (expressed load) which reduces fitness in the current generation, and the potential/masked load (inbreeding load) which quantifies the potential fitness loss due to (partially) recessive deleterious mutations that may become expressed in future generations depending on the population's demography. The genetic load is made up of realized plus masked load.

# Calculating genetic load

There are generally three most commonly used computational approaches to identify putatively deleterious variants from whole genome re-sequencing data. In general, these tools attempt to predict the effect of a mutation on the function or evolutionary fitness of a protein. The two are distinct but can be related; for instance, a loss of function mutation will be strongly selected against if the gene is essential but will tend to be less evolutionary deleterious if the gene is non-essential or if the variant only slightly alters protein function.

-   Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP): This approach uses multi-species genome alignments to identify genomic sites that are strongly conserved over millions of years of evolution, as non-synonymous mutations at these sites have a high likelihood of being deleterious. [@davydovIdentifyingHighFraction2010]

-   SNP effect (SnpEff): This approach predicts the consequences of genomic variants on protein sequences and identifies loss of function and missense variants. [@cingolani2012].

# Black grouse

In this project, we calculate genetic load based on both GERP scores and SnpEff annotations. Our dataset consists of 190 whole genomes of black grouse (*Lyrurus tetrix*) males. In addition to genotypes, we have various phenotypic traits such as sexual traits (measured per year) and fitness data such as survival and lifetime mating success (LMS).
